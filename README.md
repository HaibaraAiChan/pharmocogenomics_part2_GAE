#### GCN+VAE (Graph Convolutional Network & AutoEncoder)   
![steps](images/steps.png)
#### Steps:  

    1. Data preprocess:
       generate sub graph for each target protein
        i) order all neighbors by distance through shortest path algorithm(igraph env python3.5 or 3.6)
        ii)get fixed bumber K neighbors (K needs adjustment by experiment)(env python3.7 igraph can plot())
    2. Preprocess all sub graph to matrix format (A,X,â€¦)
    3. Each sub-graph as an instance, feeding to GCN Auto-encoder network
    4. Collect target protein node latent vector from Z matrix
#### Warnings 
    in data preprocess python-igraph lib has some python version compatible problem.
    Some functions about geting shortest path works in Python 3.5 or 3.6(not works in 3.7)
    some graph ploting functions only work on python 3.7
    Hence, after all the shortest path of target proteins are genarated, conda env should change to Python 3.7
