preprocess_dataset.py makes 'original_data/' folder's files to 'index_ENSP/' files
                      there are many data not match problems.

gen_undirected_graph_index.py 
                             after generate 'graph_index.csv', which is directed graph file (A<-->B)
                             as we use undirected graph, so, change to A--B.
gen_graph_pkl.py
                As the graph loading time will cost several mins, just save graph structure to 'undirected_dataset.pkl' file.
                every time just loading pkl file dirctly(several seconds)
                
hpc_multi.py
              generate all the target protein nodes' shortest path to all the other nodes in the whole graph.
              local running:
                  $ python simple_hpc_multi.py --infile input/0.in (1.in,2.in ...8.in)
                   output folder (default): 'target_node_shortest_path/'
                   graph_structure_model(defalut):'undirected_dataset.pkl'
              hpc running:
                  needs hpc folder
                  input list: cut the original target protein list to 9 input files. They are put in input folder.
                  $ qsub.scipt
                  Warning: remember to load module Gnu-parallel  in '.modules file'
